## Three ways to check whether a port is open on remote Linux system?
https://www.2daygeek.com/how-to-check-whether-a-port-is-open-on-the-remote-linux-system-server/

It can be done using the following Linux commands.

1. nc: Netcat is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol.

2. nmap: Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks.

3. telnet: The telnet command is used for interactive communication with another host using the TELNET protocol.

### How to Check Remote Ports are Reachable Using ‘nc’ Command

#### 安装nc(netcat)
1. Mac 自带nc
2. # yum install nc                  [On CentOS/RHEL]
3. # dnf install nc                  [On Fedora 22+]
4. $ sudo apt-get install netcat     [On Debian/Ubuntu]


We can use it to: open TCP connections, listen on arbitrary TCP and UDP ports, send UDP packets, do port scanning under both IPv4 and IPv6 and beyond.

$ nc [-options] [HostName or IP] [PortNumber]

Using netcat, you can check if a single or multiple or a range of open ports as follows. The command below will help us see if the port 22 is open on the host 192.168.56.10:

```
nc -zv 192.168.1.15 22
```
In the command above, the flag:

-z – zero-I/O mode (used for scanning). sets nc to simply scan for listening daemons, without actually sending any data to them.
-v – enables verbose mode.

[Verbose mode](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/verbose-mode.htm)

It is also possible to specify a range of ports to be scanned:’
```
$ nc -zv 192.168.56.10 20-80
```

### How to check whether a port is open on the remote Linux system using nmap Command?

$ nmap [-options] [HostName or IP] [-p] [PortNumber]

```
# nmap 192.168.1.8 -p 22

Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-03-16 03:37 IST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.8
Host is up (0.00031s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.06 seconds
```

### How to check whether a Port is open on the remote Linux system using telnet command?
$ telnet [HostName or IP] [PortNumber]

If it is  success then you will be getting the following output.
```
$ telnet 192.168.1.9 22
Trying 192.168.1.9...
Connected to 192.168.1.9.
Escape character is '^]'.
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.3

Connection closed by foreign host.
```
