## Logical vs. Physical CPU performance
CPU性能表现(逻辑核心 vs 物理核心)

The concept of cores is not that simple. Logical cores are the number of Physical cores times the number of threads that can run on each cores. This is known as HyperThreading. If I have a computer that has a 4-core processor, runs two threads per core, then I have a 8 logical processors. You can see your computers core capabilities by running lscpu command.
逻辑核心数=物理核心*每个核可以运行的线程数 
这个被称作超级线程
如果一个4核处理器，每个核可以运行2个线程，那么就有8个逻辑处理器
```
[root@vultr ~]# lscpu 
Architecture:          x86_64
CPU op-mode(s):        32-bit, 64-bit
Byte Order:            Little Endian
CPU(s):                1
On-line CPU(s) list:   0
Thread(s) per core:    1
Core(s) per socket:    1
```

If a processor has 4 cores, but it can run 8 threads in parallel, means that it only has 4 physical cores (processing units). But its hardware can support up to 8 threads in parallel. Clearly maximum of 4 jobs can run in the cores. One job running in the core, if by any means stalls for memory or I/O operation then another thread can use that free core.

You should now understand that if your computer has 2 physical cores, and can run 2 threads per core, then you have 4 logical processors. So you can run only 2 instances as you have 2 physical cores, that means you're using the full capabilities of single physical cores (2 threads at a time). So the throughput will be 50%. But if anytime one thread goes idle, then the core can load up one thread on that core.

You can turn off the HyperThreading in BIOS(something like "Intel ht technology") and see the difference between normal and HyperThreading capabilities as now the throughput will be 100%.

Windows’ Task Manager shows this fairly well. Here, for example, you can see that this system has one actual CPU (socket) and four cores. Hyperthreading makes each core look like two CPUs to the operating system, so it shows 8 logical processors.

The more CPUs or cores a computer has, the more things it can do at once, helping improve performance on most tasks.
