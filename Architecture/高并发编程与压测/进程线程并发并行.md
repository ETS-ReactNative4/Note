Parallelism: If one problem is solved by multiple processors.

## Concurrency
A condition that exists when at least two threads are making progress. A more generalized form of parallelism that can include time-slicing as a form of virtual parallelism.

当至少有两个线程正在执行。是一种更一般化的并行形式，可以将时间切片作为虚拟并行的一种形式。

## Parallelism 
A condition that arises when at least two threads are executing simultaneously.

当至少两个线程同时执行时出现的一种情况。
