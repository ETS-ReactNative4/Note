## Software as a Service (SaaS)

软件即服务

Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. 

SaaS 是一种软件发行的模式，第三方通过互联网把应用程序提供给消费者使用。

**Advantages**
SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware acquisition, provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support. Other benefits of the SaaS model include:

SaaS 不需要用户在自己的服务器或者数据中心安装应用程序，减少了企业硬件的开销，而且还为用户提供维护和技术支持。

其他优势：
Scalable usage: Cloud services like SaaS offer high vertical scalability, which gives customers the option to access more, or fewer, services or features on-demand.

有高扩展性，伸缩性

SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).

SaaS 是云计算的主要分类之一，还有IaaS,PaaS 平台即服务。
