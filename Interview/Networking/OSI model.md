## OSI model

The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology.

### Layer architecture

1. Physical Layer 物理层

The physical layer is responsible for the transmission and reception of unstructured raw data between a device and a physical transmission medium. 

负责 设备之间源数据的传输和接收

2. Data Link Layer 数据链路层

The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer—a link between two directly connected nodes. 

提供两个直连节点之间的 点对点 数据传输

3. Network Layer 网络层

The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from one node to another connected in "different networks". 

4. Transport Layer 传输层

The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.

TCP

UDP


5. Session Layer 

The session layer controls the dialogues (connections) between computers.

6. Presentation Layer

The presentation layer establishes context between application-layer entities, in which the application-layer entities may use different syntax and semantics if the presentation service provides a mapping between them.

7. Application Layer

The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with the software application. 

应用层 是OSI距离 用户最近的 一层，也就是 用户操作的软件应用。
