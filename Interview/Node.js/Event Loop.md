## What is the Event Loop?
The event loop is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations

Two types: events and event handlersï¼š

Events can be, for example, low-level operating system events such as "file is ready to be written" or "there's a fresh new HTTP request coming our way". 
Event handlers are pieces of program code that are meant to be executed when that specific event takes place.

Event loop repeatedly takes events and executes event listeners.

## setImmediate() vs setTimeout()

## process.nextTick()

### Why use process.nextTick()?
There are two main reasons:
1. Allow users to handle errors, cleanup any then unneeded resources, or perhaps try the request again before the event loop continues.
2. At times it's necessary to allow a callback to run after the call stack has unwound but before the event loop continues.
