## What is BDD?

Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is a set of practices that aim to reduce some common wasteful activities in software development:

- Rework caused by misunderstood or vague requirements
- Technical debt caused by reluctance to refactor code
- Slow feedback cycles caused by silos and hand-overs

BDD aims to narrow the communication gaps between team members, foster better understanding of the customer and promote continuous communication with real world examples.
