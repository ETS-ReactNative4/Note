## What makes a good testing framework?
Testing frameworks are a dime a dozen. In order to pick something that works for your use case, you need to evaluate each framework based on your needs and characteristics. Below are a few points that are essential for a good testing framework:

Ease of setup – getting up and running with your tests should take a minimal amount of effort
Well supported – there is plenty of excellent documentation and communities to get help
A wide array of feature sets – the framework has things such as matchers, spies, mocking in-built
Speed – for tests that are CPU bound, choosing the right framework can save you a lot of time during test runs
Ease of reporting – coverage reports should be easy to generate using in-built reporting or external reporting libraries should be easy to intergrate
A good testing library should be easy to integrate into your continuous integration process
