## connect
https://github.com/senchalabs/connect#readme

Connect is a middleware layer for Node.js

```JavaScript
var connect = require('connect');
var http = require('http');

var app = connect();

// gzip/deflate outgoing responses
var compression = require('compression');
app.use(compression());

// store session state in browser cookie
var cookieSession = require('cookie-session');
app.use(cookieSession({
    keys: ['secret1', 'secret2']
}));

// parse urlencoded request bodies into req.body
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));

// respond to all requests
app.use(function(req, res){
  res.end('Hello from Connect!\n');
});

//create node.js http server and listen on port
http.createServer(app).listen(3000);
```

## Express Advantages  lts-4.17.1
- Simple, flexible and scalable.
- Fast app development.
- Fully customizable.
- Low learning curve.
- Easy integration of third-party services and middleware.
- Majorly focused on browsers, making templating and rendering an almost out of the box feature.

## Express Disadvantages
Although Express.js is a very convenient and easy-to-use framework, it has some minor drawbacks that may influence the development process.

它的功能完善可能是它的缺点-臃肿

## How is Koa different than Connect/Express?  koa-2.11.0
- Promises-based control flow,No callback hell.

- Better error handling through try/catch.

- Koa is barebones
  Unlike both Connect and Express, Koa does not include any middleware.

- Unlike Express, routing is not provided.

- Unlike Express, many convenience utilities are not provided. For example, sending files.

- Koa is more modular.
