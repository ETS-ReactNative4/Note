## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript has a lot of features like compile-time checking, 

type inference, type erasure, interfaces, enumerated type, generic, namespaces, tuple, await, classes, modules, optional or default parameters, anonymous functions.

It is more scalable and we can build robust components. It is independent of platform, browser and operating system also. It presents the method for the developer to express variables, arrays, and properties in a non-standard javascript way.

TypeScript is superior to other scripting languages comparatively like Dart. 

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript does not require a specific environment setup for the execution. It can be run where JavaScript can run easily. The benefits of using the typescript are that it will compile the code and check the compilation errors. 

It also finds the syntax error and tells before the running of the script.

## Type category

Type can be of three types: 
1. Any type: – By using any data type, it means type checking for a variable cannot be done. 

2. Built-in type: – the data types which are already there in a system like a number, string, boolean, void, null and undefined. Null means that the variable has been set to an object whose value is undefined. Undefined means that the variable has no value or object assigned to it. 

3. User-defined data types: – the data types which are declared by the user like enums, classes, arrays, etc. One of the types is also referred to as Type Alias

### interface

TypeScript interface refers to the syntax that a system needs to follow. It is a virtual structure that exists within the context of typescript. It is mainly used for type checking purposes.

An interface also defines the methods and events. It contains the only declaration of the members. Interface members should be declared by the derived class.


Below is the top 6 Differences Between TypeScript Type vs Interface

1. Definition
- TypeScript Type: it allows the creation of new name for a type.
- Interface provides the powerful way to define entities.

2. Capabilities
- TypeScript Type: Type are with less capabilities comparatively.
- Interface provides us with more capabilityes.

3. Declarations
- ...: Type cannot have multiple merged declaratios.
- ...: Interface can have multiple merged declarations.

4. Extend
- ...: Type for an object cannot be used.
- ...: Interface can be used in conjunction with other keywords.

5. Identical Name
- ...: if two types are having identical names it will throw an exception.
- ...: if two interfaces are having identical names it will get merged.

6. Implemented
- ...: Type cannot be implemented, it can be declared only.
- ...: interface members are getting implemented by the derived class.
