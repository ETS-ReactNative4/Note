> The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

```
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

## 用于统计阶段
```sql
mysql> select * from customers;
+----+---------------------+-----------------+---------+---------+
| id | name                | address         | city    | country |
+----+---------------------+-----------------+---------+---------+
|  1 | Alfreds Futterkiste | Obere Str. 57   | Berlin  | Germany |
|  2 | Antonio             | Mataderos 2312  | London  | UK      |
|  3 | Eastern             | Mataderos 23889 | Sevilla | Spain   |
|  4 | Jack                | Opps            | Beijing | UK      |
+----+---------------------+-----------------+---------+---------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> select country,count(id) as count from customers group by country;
+---------+-------+
| country | count |
+---------+-------+
| Germany |     1 |
| UK      |     2 |
| Spain   |     1 |
+---------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

mysql> select country,count(id) as count from customers group by country having count >= 2;
+---------+-------+
| country | count |
+---------+-------+
| UK      |     2 |
+---------+-------+
1 row in set (0.05 sec)
```

## having 之后还可以order by
```
SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```
