## [Pointers](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/1)
Go has pointers. A pointer holds the memory address of a value.

The type *T is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is nil.
```go
var p *int
```

The & operator generates a pointer to its operand(操作对象).
```go
i := 42
p = &i
```

The * operator denotes(指示) the pointer's underlying value.
```go
fmt.Println(*p) // read i through the pointer p
*p = 21         // set i through the pointer p
```
Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.

## 例子
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    i, j := 42, 2701

    p := &i             
    fmt.Println(*p)
    *p = 21
    fmt.Println(i)

    p = &j
    *p = *p / 37
    fmt.Println(j)
}
// 42
// 21
// 73
```
