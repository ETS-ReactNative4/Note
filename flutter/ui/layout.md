# layout

> The core of Flutter’s layout mechanism is widgets.

## Container

Container is a widget class that allows you to customize its child widget. Use a Container when you want to add padding, margins, borders, or background color, to name some of its capabilities.

## Add the visible widget to the layout widget

* A child property if they take a single child – for example, Center or Container
* A children property if they take a list of widgets – for example, Row, Column, ListView, or Stack.

## Stack

Use Stack to arrange widgets on top of a base widget—often an image. The widgets can completely or partially overlap the base widget.
