# note

> In Flutter, almost everything is a widget, including alignment, padding, and layout.

## Stateless widgets

Stateless widgets are immutable, meaning that their properties can’t change—all values are final.

## Stateful widgets

Stateful widgets maintain state that might change during the lifetime of the widget.
