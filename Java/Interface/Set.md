Interface Set<E>

Type Parameters:
E - the type of elements maintained by this set
All Superinterfaces:
Collection<E>, Iterable<E>

A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element. As implied by its name, this interface models the mathematical set abstraction.
