## Access Modifiers(访问修饰符)

- public	The code is accessible for all classes	
- private	The code is only accessible within the declared class	
- default	The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter	
- protected	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses in the Inheritance chapter

## Non-Access Modifiers
- final	The class cannot be inherited by other classes (You will learn more about inheritance in the Inheritance chapter)	
- abstract	The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class. You will learn more about inheritance and abstraction in the Inheritance and Abstraction chapters)
