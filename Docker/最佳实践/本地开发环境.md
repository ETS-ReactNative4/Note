[Simplified guide to using Docker for local development environment](https://blog.atulr.com/docker-local-environment/)

## Docker-Compose
> Docker compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: '3'
services:
  <service_name_1>:
    build: <path_to_docker_file_of_service>
    command: <start_command_to_run>
    environment:
      - <env_var_1>=<env_val_1>
      - <env_var_2>=<env_val_2>
    ports:
      - '<port_inside_container>:<port_of_host_machine>'
    working_dir: <path_inside_the_docker_container_where_command_should_run>

  <service_name_2>: ....
    ....
    ....
```

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  njs1:
    build: ./njs1
    command: sh -c "npm install && npm start"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - PORT=7000
    ports:
      - '7000:7000'
    working_dir: /root/njs1
    volumes:
      - ./njs1:/root/njs1:cached # <--- This will map ./njs1 to /root/njs1 inside the container.
```
The above docker compose file has only one service (njs1). We will add more services incrementally. Before that lets run it and see what we get.

In the folder which contains our docker-compose.yml run:
```
docker-compose up

NJS1 app listening on port 7000!
```

### volumes
volumes gives us a way to map our local directories to a directory inside the container. 
Here we are saying map njs1 folder from our local machine to /root/njs1 inside the docker container. 
Here we are not copying the files into the container, instead we are mounting it as a shared volume. And thats the trick that makes it useful.

这个技巧可以用于开发热更新
```
cd njs1
npm install --save-dev nodemon


njs1/package.json
...
...
...
  "description": "A sample nodejs server",
   "main": "index.js",
   "scripts": {
-    "start": "node index.js"
+    "start": "nodemon index.js"
   },
...
...
```
docker-compose up --build

The --build tells docker-compose to rebuild the images.

Try making some changes in the njs1/index.js file and you should see nodemon auto reloading on file change.


**final yml**
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  njs1:
    build: ./njs1
    command: sh -c "npm install && npm start"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - PORT=7000
    ports:
      - '7000:7000'
    working_dir: /root/njs1
    volumes:
      - ./njs1:/root/njs1:cached # <--- This will map ./njs1 to /root/njs1 inside the container.

  njs2:
    image: node:12.3-alpine
    command: sh -c "npm install && npm start"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
      - PORT=8000
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    working_dir: /root/njs2
    volumes:
      - ./njs2:/root/njs2:cached # <--- This will map ./njs2 to /root/njs2 inside the container.

  py1:
    image: python:3-stretch
    command: sh -c "pip install -r requirements.txt && python -m server"
    environment:
      - PORT=9000
      - FLASK_ENV=development
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
    working_dir: /root/py1
    volumes:
      - ./py1:/root/py1:cached # <--- This will map ./py1 to /root/py1 inside the container.

  go1:
    image: golang:1.12-alpine
    command: sh -c "go run ."
    environment:
      - PORT=5000
    ports:
      - '5000:5000'
    working_dir: /root/go1
    volumes:
      - ./go1:/root/go1:cached # <--- This will map ./py1 to /root/py1 inside the container.
```

### image
image: instead of build : In docker-compose we can specify the docker image from docker-hub directly instead of 
a dockerfile using the image: property. Hence for simple setups we dont need to write our own Dockerfile.

指定本地镜像
```yml
version: '2'
services:
  ding-talk-notify-service:
    image: ding-talk-notify-service:0.0.1
    network_mode: "bridge"
    ports:
      - "10010:10010"
    environment:
      - "TZ=Asia/Shanghai"
      - "APP_PORT=10010"
      - "CONF_PATH=./configs"
      - "LOG_PATH=./logs"
      - "LOG_NAME=app.log"
      - "MODE=release"
    volumes:
      - ./configs:/configs
      - ./logs:/logs
      - ./store:/store
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "2"
```

[使用Dockerfile生成镜像](../image.md)

### docker-compose 相关命令
```
docker-compose start

docker-compose stop

docker-compose up njs1

docker-compose restart njs1

docker-compose logs -f njs1  # This will show logs of only njs1 and also watch for more logs
```
