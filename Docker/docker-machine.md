Docker Machine is a tool that lets you install Docker Engine on virtual hosts, and manage the hosts with docker-machine commands. 

- I have an older desktop system and want to run Docker on Mac or Windows

- I want to provision Docker hosts on remote systems

Whatâ€™s the difference between Docker Engine and Docker Machine?
